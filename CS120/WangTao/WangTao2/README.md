The main software used in our project is DEVC++ This time we do a project about games . We are going to implement this project in Python. First, an idea. The main content
of all games is the internal loop of the program, which is the premise to ensure the normal operation of a game. First, we need to invoke a third-party database and 
initial setup. Python differs from other languages in that it has many third-party libraries to call. When writing games in Python, PyGame is an easy to use third-party 
library that can be installed directly through PIP. The installation method has been covered in previous articles and will not be repeated. Those who want to learn more 
about PyGame's features can also consult the official documentation. The databases we need to write Snake are: PyGame, SYS, Time, random Then there are many other parts, 
such as: loop, initial settings, the main part of the game, operation, error correction, and so on.
